The purpose of this project is to investigate how the entry of Chobani in 2007 influenced the sales of Yoplait yoghurt. We have national-level weekly data on (1) total unit sales of Yoplait products, (2) average unit price of Yoplait products, (3) average unit price of Dannon products,which is a substitute for Yoplait yoghurt, and (4) average unit price of Chobani products between 2001 and 2011.
Our analysis includes plotting the data to observe patterns. We also estimate a linear demand curve for Yoplait. Finally, we compute weekly price elasticities of Yoplait demand (own- and two cross-price elasticities) to draw inference about competitive structure, particularly whether the price elasticities changed as a result of Chobani’s entry.
